		<h1>Jan 2024: We can show you in-app news!</h1>

        <p>
            We can now show you news snippets from 
            <a href="https://news.psychopy.org">news.psychopy.org</a> within the app.
        <p>
            This is a new feature but we hope it will be a handy way to keep you up to date with
            new features, bug fixes, and community news.
